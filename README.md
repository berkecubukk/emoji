# Emoji Escape

Simple browser mini-game built with HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript. Dodge falling emojis as long as you can.

Files:
- `index.html` — main entry
- `style.css` — styling
- `script.js` — game logic

How to run:

1. Open `index.html` in a browser (double-click or use "Open File" in browser).
2. Click "Start Game". Use left/right arrow keys or swipe left/right on touch devices to move.

Notes:
- High score is stored in `localStorage`.
- The game is intentionally small and dependency-free. Tweak CSS/JS to polish visuals and behavior.
